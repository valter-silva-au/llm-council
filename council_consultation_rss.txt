# Progress Report & Consultation Request

## Progress Update

Council members, I'm reporting back as your implementation agent. Since your strategic roadmap deliberation, we've successfully completed:

✅ **API/MCP Server (v2.0.0)** - Your primary recommendation
- RESTful API operational at /api/v1
- API key authentication with rate limiting
- MCP tool definitions for AI assistant integration
- All endpoints tested and working
- Documentation complete (API.md)

✅ **Supporting Infrastructure**
- Deliberation archive system (institutional memory)
- Multi-provider web search (real-time knowledge)
- Individual response controls (transparency)

## Current State

The foundation you recommended is built and operational. External applications and AI assistants can now consult the council programmatically.

## Next: RSS Automation Pipeline (Your Secondary Recommendation)

You recommended building an RSS automation pipeline as a proof-of-concept to:
- Demonstrate the council's analytical capabilities
- Validate the API infrastructure
- Create a living, AI-curated news analysis platform
- Auto-commit to GitHub → publish to GitHub Pages

## Specific Implementation Questions

I need your strategic guidance on these key decisions:

### 1. RSS Feed Selection & Scope

**Options:**
- **Tech News Focus**: TechCrunch, Hacker News, Ars Technica, The Verge
- **AI/ML Research**: arXiv CS.AI, Papers with Code, AI newsletters
- **General Tech+Business**: Reuters Tech, Bloomberg Tech, WSJ Tech
- **Security/DevOps**: Krebs, Schneier, DevOps Digest
- **Broad Multi-Domain**: Mix of all above

**Question:** Which domain gives the best demonstration of council capabilities? Should we go narrow and deep, or broad and diverse?

### 2. Analysis Questions & Format

**For each RSS article, what should we ask you?**

Option A: Generic Analysis
- "Summarize the key points and analyze the implications"

Option B: Structured Q&A
- "What are the 3 main takeaways?"
- "What are the potential benefits and risks?"
- "How does this relate to broader industry trends?"

Option C: Domain-Specific
- Tech: "What's the market impact?"
- Research: "What's the technical significance?"
- News: "What are the geopolitical implications?"

**Question:** What question format showcases collective wisdom best? Generic flexibility or structured depth?

### 3. Publishing Frequency & Volume

**Options:**
- **Real-time**: Analyze articles as they arrive (high volume, immediate)
- **Daily Digest**: Top 5-10 articles per day (manageable, curated)
- **Weekly Roundup**: Best 10-15 articles of the week (selective, thoughtful)
- **Event-Driven**: Major breaking news only (reactive, high-impact)

**Question:** What frequency demonstrates value without overwhelming? Quality vs. quantity trade-off?

### 4. GitHub Pages Presentation

**Format Options:**
- **Simple Blog**: Chronological markdown posts, one per analysis
- **Categorized Archive**: Organized by topic (AI, Security, Business, etc.)
- **Dashboard Style**: Single page with latest analyses, searchable
- **Jekyll/Hugo Site**: Professional static site with navigation
- **Raw Archive**: Just markdown files, no styling (developer-focused)

**Question:** What presentation makes the council's wisdom most accessible and impressive?

### 5. Automation Infrastructure

**Deployment Options:**
- **Cron Job**: Simple scheduled script on server
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow runs on schedule, commits results
- **Separate Service**: Dedicated RSS bot with monitoring
- **Hybrid**: GitHub Actions for commits, separate for analysis
- **Manual First**: Test workflow manually before automating

**Question:** What's the MVP approach? Should we automate fully from the start or iterate?

### 6. Content Governance

**Quality Controls:**
- Should we filter articles (minimum quality threshold)?
- Should we skip duplicate/similar topics?
- Should we add human review before publishing?
- Should we highlight council disagreements vs. consensus?

**Question:** How do we maintain quality while staying automated? What's the governance model?

### 7. Branding & Attribution

**How should we present this?**
- "Analyzed by the LLM Council" with model names listed?
- Anonymous council wisdom (no model attribution)?
- Show individual model perspectives alongside synthesis?
- Include confidence scores or consensus metrics?
- Link back to full deliberation archives?

**Question:** How transparent should we be about the process? What builds credibility?

## Your Task

As the council, please deliberate on:

1. **Which option for each question makes the most strategic sense?**
2. **What's the optimal MVP scope** to demonstrate value quickly?
3. **What trade-offs should we prioritize** (speed vs. quality, breadth vs. depth, automation vs. curation)?
4. **What's missing from this plan** that we should consider?
5. **What would make this RSS analysis truly unique and valuable** compared to existing AI summaries?

## Context

This RSS pipeline will be:
- The **first public showcase** of council capabilities
- A **living demonstration** of multi-model deliberation
- **Proof that the API works** for automated use cases
- Potentially **high-visibility** if done well

The choices we make here set the template for future automated council applications.

**What's your collective wisdom on building this showcase?**
