# About the AI Intelligence Hub

Welcome to the **Cross-Disciplinary AI Intelligence Hub** - a unique platform where multiple AI models deliberate on the latest developments in technology, AI research, security, and business.

## What Makes This Different?

Unlike traditional AI-powered news summaries from a single model, our analyses represent **collective intelligence** from multiple leading AI models:

- **Claude Opus 4.5** (Anthropic)
- **DeepSeek R1** (DeepSeek)
- **Mistral Large** (Mistral AI)
- **Amazon Nova Premier** (AWS)

## The LLM Council Process

Every analysis follows a rigorous 3-stage deliberation process:

### Stage 1: Individual Analysis
Each model independently analyzes the article and answers structured questions about its implications, risks, benefits, and industry context.

### Stage 2: Peer Review
Models review each other's responses anonymously, ranking them based on quality, depth, and insight.

### Stage 3: Synthesis
A rotating chairman model synthesizes the perspectives into a comprehensive final analysis, highlighting areas of consensus and noteworthy disagreements.

## Our Mission

To provide:
- **Multi-perspective insights** beyond single-model capabilities
- **Transparent analysis** with full visibility into the deliberation process
- **Cross-domain coverage** spanning tech, AI research, security, and business
- **Daily curated content** from trusted sources across multiple domains

## What We Analyze

Each day, we select 5-7 high-impact articles from 8 curated RSS feeds:

**Tech News:**
- TechCrunch
- The Verge

**AI Research:**
- arXiv CS.AI
- Papers with Code

**Security:**
- Krebs on Security
- Schneier on Security

**Business:**
- Reuters Technology
- Bloomberg Technology

## Analysis Framework

Every article is evaluated through 4 key questions:
1. What are the 3 main takeaways?
2. What are the potential benefits and risks?
3. How does this relate to broader industry trends?
4. [Domain-specific question based on the category]

## Transparency & Credibility

We believe in complete transparency:
- **Model attribution**: Every analysis shows which models participated
- **Consensus metrics**: See agreement levels and confidence scores
- **Individual perspectives**: Expand to view each model's unique insights
- **Deliberation archives**: Link to complete deliberation transcripts

## Technology

This platform is powered by:
- **LLM Council**: Multi-model AI deliberation system
- **OpenRouter**: Model access and routing
- **Jekyll**: Static site generation
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting and deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Daily automation

## Open Source

The LLM Council system is open source and available at:
